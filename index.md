# Dashboarduino

This is a project that came about whilst lying in bed one night, when the
thought came to me "I wonder if I could get a car dashboard to work with ETS2?"

A couple of months (and quite a bit of trial and error) later, and I have a
working 2006 Mondeo dashboard displaying the data that I have from ETS2.

Not all functionality works - the mileage for example doesn't, neither does the
outside temperature sensor, but the majority of it does. (The fuel guage I am
working on, but it's proving more tricky than original anticipated)

This repository hosts the code that I have created / borrowed and is published
under the MIT license. If you have a Mondeo dashboard, an arduino, and a few
other bits then you, too, can have a working dashboard instrument cluster.
